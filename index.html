<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.  

Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder as this project (hint: simplify the name). You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image name on the style.css page to match you image asset.

Now, change the other relevant information in this section, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"-->

      <!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes--improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you?

  <h1>Field and Career</h1>
    
  <h2>To me, the study of digital narrative allows one to become a modern day storyteller. Like the storytellers of old, it is your job to educate and entertain, but more importantly, it is your duty to pass on knowledge. In ancient times, these storytellers were limited to the regions they could physically travel to, as well as their mediums of conveying a story. 
      
      Nowadays, we are blessed with the Internet and Social Media, which allow our reach to be global and our mediums to be diverse. I have noticed how things such as music, movies and tv shows, books, and even platforms such as YouTube have influenced our collective culture to an insane degree throughout my life. Upon realizing that they are all different methods of telling a story, I became interested in pursuing that as a career. </h2>

Add those beautiful, meaningful "family" and "home" photos (only you can define family) to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace/add the names of your assets to the grid below. You can add more photos if you wish, or subtract... see what happens â€“ you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. You may need to adjust the size of your assets to produce the effect you desire. Resizing local files is one way to control the size of images on a website.-->

The second exception (the bottom right photo in the photo grid), features myself, my younger brother, and my older brother soaking up the sun on a nice day in Crete. My brothers and I are close; close in age, similar in appearance (so some people say), and good friends with each other.  </h2>

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment. You can't break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->

  <h2>Personally, I love media, specifically music and movies. Media is so powerful in it's ability to invoke empathy and create connections across wide groups of diverse people.
